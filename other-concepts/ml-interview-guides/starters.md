## 🔹 **1. Deep Generative Models**

### Q1: Explain the differences between Diffusion Models, VAEs, and GANs. When would you use each?

**Answer:**

* **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** use a generator and discriminator in a min-max game. Best for sharp images but may suffer from mode collapse.
* **VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)** are probabilistic models that learn latent representations; they offer better latent space interpretability but may produce blurrier images.
* **Diffusion Models** gradually add noise to data and then learn to reverse the process. They offer high sample fidelity and are currently state-of-the-art in image and video generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
* **Use cases:**

  * Use **GANs** for real-time generation where speed matters.
  * Use **VAEs** for tasks needing latent vector manipulation or interpolation.
  * Use **Diffusion Models** for high-quality image/video generation when speed is less critical or can be optimized.

### Q2: What are the challenges in training Diffusion Models, and how can they be mitigated?

**Answer:**

* **Challenges:**

  * Computationally expensive due to long sampling steps.
  * Memory usage is high for video data.
  * Hard to control outputs (less deterministic).
* **Mitigations:**

  * Use **DDIM sampling** for fewer steps.
  * Apply **classifier-free guidance** for controllability.
  * Implement **model distillation** (e.g., from diffusion to a smaller model).
  * Use **U-Net based architectures with attention** for efficiency.

## 🔹 **2. Video and Lipsync Generation**

### Q3: How would you approach building a speech-to-lip movement synchronization system?

**Answer:**

* **Pipeline:**

  1. **Audio Feature Extraction**: Use MFCCs or trainable CNN layers on raw audio.
  2. **Temporal Modeling**: Use Transformers or LSTMs for audio-to-face motion mapping.
  3. **Face Generation**: Use a 3D face model or render video frames using GANs/VAEs.
  4. **Losses**: Use sync loss (e.g., SyncNet), perceptual loss, and adversarial loss.
* **Datasets**: GRID, LRS3, VoxCeleb.

### Q4: What models can be used for text-to-video generation? What are the current limitations?

**Answer:**

* **Models:**

  * **Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)** for compressing video frames.
  * **Transformer-based models** for sequence modeling (e.g., VideoGPT).
  * **Multi-stage GANs** or **masked autoencoders** for frame consistency.
* **Limitations:**

  * High computation and GPU needs.
  * Maintaining **temporal coherence** across frames is difficult.
  * Dataset availability is lower compared to images.

## 🔹 **3. Multi-modal & Real-Time Systems**

### Q5: How would you optimize a multimodal generative model for real-time inference?

**Answer:**

* **Strategies:**

  * Use **model quantization** (INT8, FP16) and **pruning**.
  * Apply **model distillation** to simplify architectures.
  * Replace Transformers with **efficient variants** (e.g., Linformer, Performer).
  * Run inference with **ONNX** or **TensorRT**.
  * Optimize hardware utilization using **CUDA kernels** or **Triton Inference Server**.

### Q6: What are key considerations when deploying such models to the cloud?

**Answer:**

* **Latency**: Use GPU inference instances (e.g., AWS EC2 G5).
* **Scalability**: Use Kubernetes with autoscaling.
* **Model Serving**: Use platforms like **TorchServe**, **Triton**, or **FastAPI**.
* **Monitoring**: Track GPU/CPU usage, memory, and model response time.
* **Data Privacy**: Encrypt user data, secure model endpoints.

## 🔹 **4. Research and Experimentation**

### Q7: How do you stay current with trends in generative AI?

**Answer:**

* Regularly read **papers on arXiv** (e.g., “Papers with Code”).
* Follow leading conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV).
* Contribute to or review **open-source implementations**.
* Participate in **online research forums**, GitHub discussions, and AI Slack groups.

### Q8: Walk me through an experiment you ran to improve a generative model's performance.

**Answer:**

> *(Example Answer)*
> In a prior project, I noticed our GAN-generated faces were slightly distorted during fast head movement. I:

* Added a **temporal discriminator** to enforce frame-to-frame consistency.
* Incorporated **optical flow loss** to penalize unrealistic motion.
* Used **CLIP-based perceptual loss** to preserve semantic accuracy.
* Result: Improved video realism by \~25% based on FID and human evaluations.

### Q9: How would you design a scalable pipeline for AI-powered video content generation?

**Answer:**

* **Input**: Text/audio
* **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, audio feature extraction
* **Model Inference**:

  * Text → latent video (diffusion)
  * Audio → facial landmarks → video
* **Postprocessing**: Frame interpolation, upscaling

### Q11: Tell us about a time you had to quickly learn a new framework or concept to meet a project deadline.

**Answer:**

> *(Example Answer)*

### Q12: How do you balance between pushing state-of-the-art and delivering production-ready solutions?

**Answer:**

* Start with **baseline implementation** using proven models.
* Run **parallel research tracks** for experimental improvements.
* Use **metrics-driven decision making** to decide when to move models to production.
* Focus on **modular code** to swap in better models without overhauling the system.
